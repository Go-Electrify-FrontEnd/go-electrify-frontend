WHEN TO USE: When a driver needs to locate an available charger near their current location
PREREQUISITES:
- The driver has the Go-Electrify mobile app installed and location services enabled
- The driver's vehicle connector type is known
STEPS:
1. Open the Go-Electrify mobile app.
2. Grant location permission if prompted so the app can center the map on your current position.
3. On the home map, tap the "Nearby Stations" button or the search icon.
4. Use the filter icon to select your connector type (e.g., CCS) and preferred charger power (fast / standard).
5. Optionally toggle "Available now" to show only free chargers.
6. Tap any station pin to open the station details card.
7. Review station details: number of chargers, connector types, price, and latest availability status.
8. Tap "Navigate" or the directions icon to open your preferred mapping app for turn-by-turn directions.
9. When you arrive, follow on-screen instructions to start charging (unlock, plug in, or scan QR as required).

PROCEDURE NAME: Find nearby station (web)
WHEN TO USE: When using a laptop or browser to plan a route or check stations remotely

STEPS:
1. Open https://www.go-electrify.com and sign in if needed.
2. Click "Stations" or "Find a Station" in the site navigation.
3. Allow the browser to access location, or type an address in the search field.

=== SECTION 3: TROUBLESHOOTING ===
SCENARIO: App doesn't show nearby stations
SYMPTOMS:
- Map is blank or centered far away
- No station pins visible despite being in a serviced area
RESOLUTION STEPS:
1. Confirm device location services are enabled and the Go-Electrify app has permission to use location.
2. Pull-to-refresh the map or close and reopen the app.
3. Check network connectivity (switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data).
4. If still empty, try searching an address or a nearby landmark manually.
5. Report persistent issues using the in-app "Report a problem" tool with screenshots.

SCENARIO: Station shows "occupied" but appears available
SYMPTOMS:
- Station status shows occupied though physical charger looks free
RESOLUTION STEPS:
1. Refresh the station details to ensure you have the latest status.
2. Confirm the station's last update time; wait 30–60 seconds and refresh.
3. If status remains incorrect, contact support at support@go-electrify.com with station ID and photo.

=== SECTION 4: FAQ ===
Q: How do I know which connector fits my vehicle?
A: Check your vehicle's charge port documentation or the sticker near the port. In the app, use the connector filter to match your vehicle.

Q: Can I reserve a charger in advance?
A: Reservation functionality depends on the station. Use the station details card to see if reservations are supported and create one if available.

Q: Why am I asked to enable location?
A: Enabling location lets the app show stations near you automatically and provide accurate travel directions.
